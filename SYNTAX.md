# Language Syntax

The language is currently only capable of recognizing individual tokens, it doesn't actually recognize semantics errors.

## Literals

Positive base 10 number literals of arbitrary length (no restrictions for now): ```2```, ```10```

## Symbols

### Brackets 

```(```, ```)``` -> enclose an expression

### Comments

Line comment: ```#...``` -> ignores everything until the end of the line

## Operators
